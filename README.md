<h1>Integration with Github using SAS Viya AI Platform</h1>

SAS Studio includes integration with Git, a system for tracking changes and managing version control among multiple users. Git can be used with many different repository hosting services such as GitHub and BitBucket.

You can use the Git Repository section of the navigation pane to access the basic Git features from within SAS Studio, including cloning repositories, committing changes to files, pulling and pushing files, viewing your repository history, creating and merging branches, and performing a basic differentiation between files in your local repository. By default, SAS Studio uses SSH keys to authenticate with your repository hosting service. You can also authenticate using HTTPS with a user name and password.
